BinaryMask
==========

Class simplifies common operations against binary streams. Useful when implementing device-linked applications using data protocols e.g. MILBUS or ARINC.

ToDos:
	- Binary shifting capability: left, right, cyclic, overwrite and extend mode
	- Reverse mask operation
	- Little/Big endian configuration
	- Add overrides for numeric types of various lengths
